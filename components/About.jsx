          As a MERN Stack and Full Stack Web Developer, I specialize in creating seamless and efficient web applications that integrate robust backend systems with modern, responsive front-end interfaces. My expertise spans across MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, allowing me to build scalable full-stack applications that handle both the user experience and the server-side logic effectively.

          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 font-semibold'>
          Starting my web development journey in 2013, I&apos;ve worked on diverse projects, from managing e-commerce platforms to building custom web applications. I bring proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and backend technologies, alongside experience working directly with clients to deliver high-quality solutions based on their requirements. My focus is on using the best tools for each task, whether it&apos;s front-end or back-end, to create optimized and user-friendly applications.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 font-semibold'>
          In addition, I&apos;m currently pursuing Generative AI course from PIAIC, where I learn advance Python and more technical skills like Docker Desktop, particularly focusing on front-end and full-stack technologies. I&apos;m passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and continuously expanding my skill set to deliver modern, efficient, and scalable solutions.
